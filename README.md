## 1. General Information
***
Kamakura Food is a practice exercise of the Femcoders' Bootcamp. The exercise consists in creating the appropriate functions to manipulate the DOM of a Japanese food e-commerce website. We are provided with an index.html file and a styles.css file whose code cannot be directly modified. To manipulate the HTML elements and achieve the desired appearance and functionality for the e-commerce site, you need to create the necessary functions in JavaScript first.
These are the abilities we have to acquire through this exercise: 

- DOM manipulation
- Conditionals
- Loops' usage
- DOM tests
- Functional programming

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us!
